        <article class="text">I have been playing League of Legends for about 6 years now, and I am proud to say that League of Legends is a very competitive MOBA game. The only way of getting better at playing the game is by practice, and that's why so many players are investing their time playing the game. League of Legends is fun when playing with your friends. Sometimes you will get frustrated at them and even punch them in the face because of your frustration. League of Legends is a mental game, and it will suck a lot of energy because 1 game will last for about 30minutes to 45 minutes. League of Legends is fun because you will meet a lot of people and you can be their friends. Playing League of Legends is hard at first. Still, after some time, you will get used to it. Eventually, you will get addicted like the other million league players around the world. League of Legends also has no age boundaries, so anyone can play it as long as they know how to use a mouse and keyboard. It's never too late to try playing League because it gets updated every 2 weeks. But before you install League of Legends to your computer, read first the story of how League of legends begun.

            League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, in which the player controls a character ("champion") with a set of unique abilities from an isometric, or top-down, perspective. Over the course of a match, champions gain levels by gaining experience points (XP) through killing non-player enemies called minions. Items also increase the strength of champions, and are bought using gold earned by killing minions, or destroying enemy structures. In the main game mode, Summoner's Rift, items are purchased through a shop menu that is only available to players when their champion is in the team's base. Each match is discrete; levels and items do not transfer from one match to another.

                    Riot Games's founders Brandon Beck and Marc Merill had an idea for a spiritual successor to the MOBA Defense of the Ancients, known as DotA. A mod for Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, DotA required players to buy Warcraft III and install custom software; The Washington Post's Brian Crecente said the mod "lacked a level of polish and was often hard to find and set up". Phillip Kollar of Polygon noted that Blizzard Entertainment supported Warcraft III with an expansion pack, then shifted their focus to other projects while the game still had players. Beck and Merill sought to create a game that would be supported over a significantly longer period of time.

                    League of Legends was announced October 7, 2008 for Microsoft Windows. Closed beta-testing began in April 2009. Upon the launch of the beta, seventeen champions were available. Riot initially aimed to ship the game with 20 champions, but doubled the number before the game's full release in North America on October 27, 2009. Although the game's full name  was announced as League of Legends: Clash of Fates, the subtitle was dropped prior to launch.

                    League of Legends receives regular updates in the form of patches. Although previous games had utilized patches to ensure no one strategy dominated, League of Legends's patches made keeping pace with the developer's changes a core part of the game. In 2014, Riot standardized their patch cadence to once approximately every two or three weeks.

                    The development team includes hundreds of game designers and artists. In 2016, the music team had four full-time composers and a team of producers creating audio for the game and its promotional materials. As of 2019, the game has over 140 champions, and frequently radically overhauls the visuals and gameplay of their oldest champions Although only available for Microsoft Windows at launch, a Mac version of the game was made available in March 2013.

                        Summoner's Rift is the flagship game mode of League of Legends and the most prominent in professional-level play. The mode has a ranked competitive ladder; a matchmaking system determines a player's skill level and generates a starting rank from which they can climb. There are nine tiers; the least skilled are Iron, Bronze, and Silver, and the highest are Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger. Two teams of five players compete to destroy the opposing team's nexus, which is guarded by the enemy champions and defensive structures known as turrets. Each team's nexus is located in their base, beside the "fountain"—where players start the game or reappear after a death. Minions, which are not controlled by players, are generated from each team's three inhibitors. These inhibitors are structures located behind the third tower of each lane. Destroying one of the enemy team's inhibitors causes stronger allied minions to spawn in that lane. Minions advance toward the opposing team's base along three lanes guarded by turrets: top, middle, and bottom. In the "jungle"—the region between lanes—are "monsters" that, like minions, reappear at regular intervals. Like minions, monsters provide gold and XP when killed. Another, more powerful class of monster resides within the river that separates each team's jungle. These monsters require multiple players to defeat and grant special abilities to their slayers' team. For example, a team that slays Baron Nashor greatly increases the durability of their minions, making it difficult for enemy players to clear them.

                    Besides Summoner's Rift, League of Legends has two other permanent game modes. ARAM ("All Random, All Mid") is a five-versus-five mode like Summoner's Rift, but with only one long lane, no jungle area, and with champions randomly chosen for players. Given the small size of the map, players must be vigilant in avoiding enemy abilities.

                    Teamfight Tactics is an auto battler released in June 2020. As with others in its genre, players build a team and battle to be the last one standing. Players do not directly affect combat, but position their units on a board for them to fight automatically against opponents each round. Teamfight Tactics is available for mobile operating systems iOS and Android, and has cross-platform play with the Windows and macOS clients.

                    Other game modes have been made available on a temporary basis. Ultra Rapid Fire (URF) mode was available for 2 weeks as a 2014 April Fools Day prank. In the mode, champion abilities have no resource cost, significantly reduced cooldown timers, increased movement speed, reduced healing, and faster attacks. URF was available for two weeks. A year later, in April 2015, Riot disclosed that they had not brought the mode back because its unbalanced design resulted in player "burnout", many quitting League of Legends entirely. The developer also said the costs associated of maintaining and balancing URF were too high.
